# closure-test
Code for DevDays FHIR $closure tutorial (Amsterdam November 2019)

This code is for a simple demonstation client application that utilizes the FHIR $closure application.  This is example code and not suitable or intended for production use, and it does not comply (or make any attempt to comply) with the recommendations of the FHIR Implementer's Safety Check List (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/safety.html).  It is strongly recommended that any production code should consider and attempt to comply as much as possible with the Safety Checklist reccomendations. 

See the excercise documentation and the tutorial slides in the 'documentation' folder for details.
